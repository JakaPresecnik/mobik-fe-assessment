# Steps to take:
* Open two terminals and do:
    * First one:
```
git clone https://github.com/JakaPresecnik/mobik-fe-assessment.git
cd mobik-fe-assessment
npm start
```
    * Second one:
```
cd client
npm start
```

## Info
* The styling is unfinished. I thought I will have 40 minutes enough for it to style, but I was wrong. I'm submitting because I want to be fair to others and to myself.
* There are bugs, that I didn't fix because I would waste more time on them.
* The server is basic, I created it because I didn't exactly know where do we fetch the data in order to complete the assessment, so I added some data in, and was modifying it when there were changes needed on the front-end.
* There are some packages installed that I didn't need as I ran out of time to be working on things that would need them.
* The negative restrictions in inputs weren't implemented.
